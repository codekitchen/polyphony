## What is Polyphony

Polyphony is a library for building concurrent applications in Ruby. Polyphony
harnesses the power of [Ruby fibers](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Fiber.html)
to provide a cooperative, sequential coroutine-based concurrency model. Under
the hood, Polyphony uses
[io_uring](https://unixism.net/loti/what_is_io_uring.html) or
[libev](https://github.com/enki/libev) to maximize I/O performance.

## Features

* Co-operative scheduling of concurrent tasks using Ruby fibers.
* High-performance event reactor for handling I/O events and timers.
* Natural, sequential programming style that makes it easy to reason about
  concurrent code.
* Abstractions and constructs for controlling the execution of concurrent code:
  supervisors, cancel scopes, throttling, resource pools etc.
* Code can use native networking classes and libraries, growing support for
  third-party gems such as `pg` and `redis`.
* Use stdlib classes such as `TCPServer`, `TCPSocket` and
  `OpenSSL::SSL::SSLSocket`.
* Competitive performance and scalability characteristics, in terms of both
  throughput and memory consumption.
